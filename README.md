# TaskFlow AI

## Project Overview

TaskFlow AI is an **intelligent team workspace and task management platform** that uses artificial intelligence to actively help teams work smarter. Unlike traditional task management tools like Jira or Asana that are merely digital task boards, TaskFlow AI learns from your team's work patterns to predict bottlenecks, suggest optimal task breakdowns, and automatically balance workloads across team members in real-time.

The platform combines the power of AI-driven insights with true real-time collaboration, creating an experience where your task management tool becomes an intelligent team member that understands how your team works and provides proactive assistance.

## Core Value Proposition

**"Where AI meets real-time collaboration"** - TaskFlow AI doesn't just track tasks; it actively analyzes team performance, predicts problems before they occur, and suggests intelligent optimizations based on historical data and current workload patterns.

### Key Differentiators

1. **AI That Actually Helps**
   - Smart task decomposition based on your team's historical performance
   - Predictive bottleneck detection ("Sarah will be overloaded next Tuesday")
   - Intelligent auto-assignment based on expertise, availability, and past performance

2. **True Real-time Collaboration**
   - Live cursors showing where teammates are working
   - Instant task updates without refresh
   - Real-time presence and activity indicators

3. **Works Everywhere, Always**
   - Full functionality without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
   - Offline mode with intelligent sync
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Progressive Web App capabilities

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React Router v7** (formerly Remix v2) - Full-stack React framework with server-side rendering and progressive enhancement
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Icon library
- **@dnd-kit** - Drag and drop functionality for Kanban boards
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives

### Backend
- **Convex** - Real-time database and serverless backend platform
  - Built-in real-time subscriptions for live collaboration
  - Serverless functions for business logic
  - Type-safe queries and mutations
  - Built-in authentication support

### Runtime & Tooling
- **Bun** - Fast, TypeScript-native JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **Neverthrow** - Type-safe error handling with Result types

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI API** - Powers AI features:
  - Task breakdown and decomposition
  - Workload prediction and analysis
  - Smart suggestions and recommendations
  - Pattern recognition in team workflows

### Key Technical Features
- **Progressive Enhancement**: App works without JavaScript for maximum accessibility
- **Real-time Sync**: Convex provides instant updates across all connected clients
- **Offline-First**: IndexedDB-based offline support with intelligent sync
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Neverthrow for error handling
- **Server-Side Rendering**: React Router provides SSR for fast initial loads and SEO

## Architecture Highlights

```

├─ Real-time Database (Tasks, Workspaces, Presence)
├─ AI Integration Layer (OpenAI API)
└─ Authentication & Authorization
```

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger React Router actions/loaders
2. Convex mutations update database in real-time
3. All connected clients receive updates via WebSocket subscriptions
4. AI analysis runs asynchronously on historical data
5. Offline changes queue in IndexedDB and sync when online

## Core Features

### Workspace Organization
- **Multi-View System**: Kanban, Sprint Planning, Calendar, Focus Mode, Priority Matrix
- **Hierarchical Workspaces**: Company → Teams → Boards → Tasks
- **Smart Organization**: AI-suggested task grouping and sprint planning

### AI Intelligence Layer
- **Task Intelligence**: Smart time estimates, dependency detection, risk alerts
- **Team Intelligence**: Load balancing, expertise matching, velocity tracking
- **Project Intelligence**: Completion forecasting, blocker pattern analysis, resource optimization

### Real-time Collaboration
- **Live Presence**: See cursors, typing indicators, and online status
- **Inline Communication**: Comments, mentions, threads on tasks
- **Activity Streams**: Personal and project-level real-time feeds

### Automation & Workflows
- **Built-in Automations**: Auto-move tasks, assign reviewers, schedule recurring tasks
- **Custom Workflows**: User-defined rules and triggers
- **Integration Ecosystem**: GitHub, Slack, Google Calendar, Email

## Development Philosophy

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with real-time features when available
2. **Type Safety**: Leveraging TypeScript and Neverthrow for robust error handling
3. **Real-time First**: Built on Convex for instant updates and collaboration
4. **AI as a Team Member**: AI provides intelligent assistance, not just automation
5. **Performance**: Bun runtime ensures fast builds and execution

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Tech startups (10-100 employees) needing flexible, AI-powered task management
- **Secondary**: Digital agencies managing multiple concurrent projects
- **Tertiary**: Enterprise innovation teams wanting modern alternatives to legacy tools

## Project Goals

This project aims to demonstrate how modern web technologies (React Router v7, Convex, Bun) can be combined with AI capabilities to create a task management experience that's both powerful and delightful. The focus is on:

- Proving real-time collaboration can coexist with progressive enhancement
- Showing AI can provide genuine value beyond simple automation
- Building a production-ready app with modern best practices
- Creating an excellent developer experience with type-safe, real-time backend

## Development Status

Currently in initial development phase, setting up:
- Project scaffolding with React Router v7 + Convex + Bun
- Database schema and real-time infrastructure
- Core CRUD operations with type-safe error handling
- Basic UI components and routing structure

Next phases will implement AI features, real-time collaboration, and advanced workflow capabilities.
